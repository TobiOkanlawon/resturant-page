  One of the best restaurants we've been to savor the best Portuguese 
  memorable dishes - wow! Warm service Great strolling area

  The cataplana was delicious! We even ordered more rice to have the sauce 
  with. I made reservations and my table was ready when I arrived. The
  service was slow because there was only one waiter. It took a while for
  him to give us the menu and take our order. However the food came out
  fast. Overall I absolutely LOVED the cataplana and I'll definitely
  return if I go back to Lagos in the future.
