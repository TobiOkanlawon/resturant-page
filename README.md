### Introduction

This project was intended as a learning project. It's objective is to test whether I can use vanilla JS to create a tabbed interface.

**I can.**

### Basic Instructions

To create the live dist folder, run the command `npx webpack`.

Feel free to fork the project.

MIT LICENSE and all that.

## Roadmap

I intend to style it. I'm sorry if you had to see it before it was styled. YIKES!
